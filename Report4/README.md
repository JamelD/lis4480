1-2 paragraph on each question please

How are YOU doing as a leader? Focus your discussion on your vision, your plans, your goals. Reflect on the last 7 weeks and your time in the class.
How am I spending my time? Can YOU account for the last 24 hours, the last week, the last 2 weeks? How much of that time was spent on reaching your goals versus spinning your wheels with daily tasks? What did YOU do in the last week to IMPROVE YOURSELF? 
Life is full of challenges that create stress and pressure. Can YOU identify 3 such events in the past week? How did you handle them? What can you do better? use the E+R=O model (google this)
When was the last time you asked someone for a “leadership” evaluation? Your personality style, your communication, your results, your motivations, your planning, etc. Who would you ask?
