Describe 3 leader related tweets (from @leadershipatfsu) - what were they about - what are your takeaways!
Do you debate, clarify, and enunciate your goals? Can you write down your personal goals for the next 1-3 years?
Can others around you tell you what those goals listed above are? Why or Why not?
Do you use any tools to plan, organize your goals? Are they written down?
How often do you sit down and review your goals and how much progress you made?
After answering the questions above (and reviewing your timetracker), will you do something different with your life plan/goals or NOT?
Referring to Emotional intelligence - review the four quadrants of the model - summarize the model in your own words. Do not rehash the model -- but explain HOW you interpret each quadrant
Using the EI model - for each quadrant, tell me how YOU will address one thing about yourself based on the definition of that quadrant.
How often do you work on YOU? Why or why not! What am I asking - well, you take classes and learn new material but how often do you do something besides school to improve you (learn a new skill, take a fun class, explore new challenges, read about a new technology or interest area).  Reference the 4 circles from class (goals for 2021).
